- 👋 Hi, I’m @Koethan, a total beginner to python and programming but have grand dreams!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... almost everything, I want to become more of a renaissance man!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...python3 and programming, I am using code academy, the odin project, 100 days of code on udemy, and a google crash course!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... many projects and hopefully some of my own original ideas!
- 📫 How to reach me ... I am on discord as koethan
- A quote I love is "It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers... That way, when he finds the answers, they'll be precious to him. The harder the question, the harder we hunt. The harder we hunt, the more we learn." - Patrick Rothfuss
